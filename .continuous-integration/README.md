About
=====

This directory contains a set of scripts that are used by the ``appveyor.yml`` files 
for the [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) service.

This folder was forked from the [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) repo.

The scripts include:

* ``appveyor/install-miniconda.ps1`` - set up conda on Windows
* ``appveyor/windows_sdk.cmd`` - set up the compiler environment on Windows
